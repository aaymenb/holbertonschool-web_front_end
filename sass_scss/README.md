Sass (Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets) is a powerful CSS preprocessor created by Hampton Catlin.
It adds useful features like variables (using $), imports (@import 'file'), and loops, such as:

@each $item in $list for “for each” loops

@while $i < 10 for while loops

Sass also allows custom function creation, making CSS more dynamic, organized, and easier to maintain.
